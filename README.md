## What is spongecake?

**spongecake** is the easiest way to launch OpenAI-powered “computer use” agents. It simplifies:
- **Spinning up** a Docker container with a virtual desktop (including Xfce, VNC, etc.).
- **Controlling** that virtual desktop programmatically using an SDK (click, scroll, keyboard actions).
- **Integrating** with OpenAI to drive an agent that can interact with a real Linux-based GUI.

---

## Prerequisites

You’ll need the following to get started (click to download):
- [**Docker**](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)  
- [**OpenAI API Key**](https://platform.openai.com/)

# Quick Start

1. **Clone the repo** (if you haven’t already):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aditya-nadkarni/spongecake.git
   cd spongecake/test
   ```
2. **Set up a Python virtual environment and install the spongecake package**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate

   python3 -m pip install --upgrade spongecake
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade dotenv
   python3 -m pip install --upgrade openai  # Make sure you have the latest version of openai for the responses API
   ```
3. **Run the test script**:  
   ```bash
   cd test # If needed
   ```
   ```bash
   python3 test.py
   ```
   Feel free to edit the `test.py` script to try out your own commands.  
   <br>
   > **Note:** This deploys a Docker container in your local Docker environment. If the spongecake default image isn't available, it will pull the image from Docker Hub.

4. **Create your own scripts**:
  The test script is largely for demonstration purposes. To make this work for own use cases, create your own scripts using the SDK or integrate it into your own systems.

# (Optional) Building & Running the Docker Container

If you want to manually build and run the included Docker image for a virtual desktop environment you can follow these steps. To make your own changes to the docker container, fork the repository and edit however you need. This is perfect for adding dependencies specific to your workflows.

1. **Navigate to the Docker folder** (e.g., `cd spongecake/docker`).
2. **Build the image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <name of your image> .
   ```
3. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5900:5900 --name <name of your container> <name of your image>
   ```
   - This starts a container that you name and exposes VNC on port **5900**.

4. **Shell into the container** (optional):
   ```bash
   docker exec -it <name of your container> bash
   ```
   This is useful for debugging, installing extra dependencies, etc.

5. You can then specify the name of your container / image when using the SDK

---

# Connecting to the Virtual Desktop
**If you're working on a mac**:
1. Right click `Finder` and select `Connect to server...`  
      OR  
   In the `Finder` window, navigate to `Go > Connect to server...` in the menu bar
2. Enter the VNC host and port - should be `vnc://localhost:5900` in the default container
3. It will ask for a password, which will be set to "`secret`" in the default docker container
4. Your mac will connect to the VNC server. You can view and control the container's desktop through here

**Other options**:
1. **Install a VNC Viewer**, such as [TigerVNC](https://tigervnc.org/) or [RealVNC](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/).
2. **Open the VNC client** and connect to:
   ```
   localhost:5900
   ```
3. Enter the password when needed (set to "`secret`" in the default docker container).

# Documentation

## Desktop Client Documentation

Below is the **Desktop** class, which provides functionality for managing and interacting with a Docker container that simulates a Linux desktop environment. This class enables you to control mouse/keyboard actions, retrieve screenshots, and integrate with OpenAI for higher-level agent logic.

---

## Class: `Desktop`

**Arguments**:
1. **name** *(str)*: A unique name for the container. Defaults to `"newdesktop"`. This should be unique for different containers
2. **docker_image** *(str)*: The Docker image name to pull/run if not already available. Defaults to `"spongebox/spongecake:latest"`.
3. **vnc_port** *(int)*: The host port mapped to the container’s VNC server. Defaults to **5900**.
4. **api_port** *(int)*: The host port mapped to the container’s internal API. Defaults to **8000**.
5. **openai_api_key** *(str)*: An optional API key for OpenAI. If not provided, the class attempts to read `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment.

**Raises**:
- **SpongecakeException** if any port is in use.
- **SpongecakeException** if no OpenAI API key is supplied.

**Description**: Creates a Docker client, sets up container parameters, and initializes an internal OpenAI client for agent integration.

---

### **`start()`**

```python
def start(self) -> Container:
    """

```

**Behavior**:
- Starts the docker container thats initialized in the Desktop() constructor
- Checks if a container with the specified `name` already exists.
- If the container exists but is not running, it starts it.  
  Note: In this case, it will not pull the latest image
- If the container does not exist, the method attempts to run it:
  - It will attempt to pull the latest image before starting the container
- Waits a short time (2 seconds) for services to initialize.
- Returns the running container object.

**Returns**:
- A Docker `Container` object representing the running container.

**Exceptions**:
- **RuntimeError** if it fails to find or pull the specified image
- **docker.errors.APIError** For any issue with running the container

## OpenAI Agent Integration

```markdown
### **`action(input=None, user_input=None, safety_checks=None, pending_call=None)`**

```python
def action(self, input=None, user_input=None, safety_checks=None, pending_call=None) -> dict:
    """
    Uses OpenAI's computer-use-preview model to control the container environment
    and possibly handle user input or safety checks.

    It is either:
    - A brand-new user command
    - A continued conversation with user_input
    - A resumed computer_call (pending_call) that was previously halted for safety checks

    Args:
        input: A string command or a "stored response" object from the model
        user_input: Optional text if the agent asked for user input
        safety_checks: A list of safety check objects that were acknowledged
        pending_call: A computer_call object we previously returned to the user (due to safety checks)
                      that now needs to be executed and followed with a screenshot, etc.

    Returns:
        dict: with "result" (the agent's output), optional "needs_input" (list of messages for the user),
              "safety_checks" (list of checks if any), and possibly "pending_call" if further action is needed.
    """
```

**Arguments**:

- **`input`** (str or response object, optional):  
  - The initial command to run or a response object from a previous action.  
  - If no user input was requested by the agent, this starts a brand-new command.  
  - If you have a stored response from the agent, you can pass it here for continuation or to resume previous state.

- **`user_input`** (str, optional):  
  - If the agent has asked for additional user input, you provide it here.  
  - This text is added to the conversation as a user message, continuing from the `input` response object.

- **`safety_checks`** (list, optional):  
  - A list of safety check objects that were acknowledged by the user.  
  - If a previous step paused for safety approval, pass the acknowledged checks here to continue.

- **`pending_call`** (object, optional):  
  - A previously returned `computer_call` (from the agent) that was halted due to safety checks.  
  - If provided, the function bypasses normal text-based input and proceeds to execute the pending call directly.

---

**Behavior**:

1. **Normal text-based flow**  
   The function either:  
   - Creates a new OpenAI response with the "computer-use-preview" model if **`user_input`** is **not** supplied.  
   - Continues the conversation from the provided `input` (response object) if **`user_input`** **is** supplied.

2. **Resuming a pending call**  
   If **`pending_call`** is provided, the function executes that call immediately, using any acknowledged **`safety_checks`**.  
   - After execution (and a screenshot step), it constructs a new response to check if more actions or messages are needed.

3. **Looping for instructions**  
   Internally, the function calls a `computer_use_loop` to process the agent’s step-by-step instructions, handle system events, and check for any further actions or messages.

---

**Returns**:

A **`dict`** with the following fields:

```json
{
  "result": { ... },           // The agent's current output or state
  "needs_input": [ ... ],      // (optional) A list of messages prompting the user for more input
  "safety_checks": [ ... ],    // (optional) A list of new or ongoing safety checks
  "pending_call": { ... }      // (optional) A call object if further execution is paused
}
```

- **`result`**  
  Always present. The final or in-progress state/output from the agent.  

- **`needs_input`**  
  If present, the agent is requesting more text input from the user to proceed.  

- **`safety_checks`**  
  A list of safety checks (if any) that must be acknowledged by the user before the agent can continue.  

- **`pending_call`**  
  If present, the agent needs this call to be executed after the user confirms any safety checks.  
  Once confirmed, call `action(..., pending_call=returned_pending_call, safety_checks=...)` to execute.  

Use these returned values to decide if you must prompt the user for more text, acknowledge safety checks, or execute a pending call.
